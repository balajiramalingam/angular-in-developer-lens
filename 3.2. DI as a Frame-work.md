In previous section we have seen about Dependency Injection, in this section we will see the role of a frame-work in realtion with Dependency Injection

In our Login example, we have created the object for "AuthenticationService" and passed it to Login method
```js
var authService = new AuthenticationService();
Login(authService);

```
The draw back of the above code is,
* Now AuthenticationService has been created with out any dependencies(new AuthenticationService()),If in future "AuthenticationService" implementaion changed to get one/more dependencies(like cookies,...) then we have to change our code to call the "Authentication service" with required dependencies
* Currently Login has only one dependency(AuthenticationService), But what If the dependency list is going to more in future, then for every dependencies we have to create object manually and pass to Login.

It makes the code more difficult to manage, this is where DI Frame-work comes into the picture.
Framework will provide(decorators in Angular) a way to configure the dependencies of a module. When the module object is required, then looking into the dependency configuration, Frame-work will create and serve the dependencies.We need not create dependency objects for module creation. In this way it help us over-come the above hurdles.


we have seen DI frame-work will allow us to configure the dependencies, Let see below the angular way of dependency configuration

Angular1 we will configure the service dependencies as below(using $inject service).

```js
angular.module('app.service')
 .factory('dataservice',dataservice);
 
 dataservice.$inject = [ '$http', '$location', '$q', 'exception', 'logger' ];
 function dataservice($http, $location, $q, exception, logger) {
 ..
 ..
 }

```
In Angular2 we will use @injector() decorator to configure the service dependencies.
```js
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HEROES }     from './mock-heroes';
@Injectable()
export class HeroService {
  getHeroes() { return HEROES; }
}
```
Note: Angular DI frame-work will provides more additional features like "Singleton, conditional dependencies creation",... will discuss those details in coming chapter.
