# Dependency Injection (DI).
   Dependency injection is the way of managing dependencies between application modules. It is the most value-added feature of Angular
   frame-work.
   
   Below details will answer the following queries about dependency injection
   * What is Dependency injection?
   
   * Advantage of having Dependency injection?
   
   * What is Dependency injection design pattern?
    
   
   In any application dependency between the modules is in-evitable, If 'Module A' required 'Module B' to do his job than, 'Module A' is depends on 'ModuleB'. Dependency between the modules will grow relative to the application size.
   Let consider the below Login function

```js
function Login(){
   var authService = new AuthenticationService();
    
   var userDetails = {
	userName: ...,
	password: ...
   }
  
   authService.signin(userDetails);

}
```

The above code has following short-comings,

``` Not re-usable: ``` In future, If we decides to use social media api's for login(eg:- Google, Facebook login) then we can't use same "Login" method. 

``` Testing is very difficult: ```
Login depends on the "AuthenticationService". we can't use 'Mock service'(in-place of "AuthenticationService") to test the code, as the "AuthenticationService" object(var authService = new AuthenticationService()) is created by "Login" method itself.

We can over-come the above problems by re-writting our code as .
  ```
  function Login(authService:AuthenticationService){
    
   var userDetails = {
	userName: ...,
	email: ...
   }
  
   authService.signin(userDetails);
}
```
Now, the dependency (Authentication service) is created from the external environment and "Login" is simply consuming it via parameter(its not creating the AuthenticationService) for do the authentication

Now we can use our "Login" method with any api(Google, Facebook, AuthenticationService, ...), as mentioned below

```
  //with our AuthenticationService
  var authService = new AuthenticationService();
  Login(authService);
```

```
//with Google api
  var authService = new GoogleAuthenticationService();
  Login(authService); 
 ```
 ```
 //with Facebook api
  var authService = new FacebookUserAuthentication();
  Login(authService); 
```

we can easily test the code as well, see the sample test case below
```
let authService;
beforeEach(() => {
authService = new MockService();
});

describe('Login', () => {
 it('should not throw error,if user credentials are valid', () => {
   expect( Login(authService) ).not.toThrowError();
});

});

```
Now our code is re-usable and testable.

This techninique of injecting the dependencies is called the inversion of control(IoC) principle. IoC is a way of implementing```"Dependency Injection design pattern"```.

Note: The inversion of control (or IoC) principle is also called “Hollywood principle” informally, that is a reference to the Hollywood's motto “don’t call us, we’ll call you”.


Summarize: Dependency injection is the design pattern to manage the dependency between the modules.Over the years it was very common for every module to be aware of the complete application context and be responsible for creating and setting up the dependencies. In our example, we can see Login is fully aware of Authentication service.The draw-back of this is, If we make change to a module(AuthenticationService) on which many other modules(Login) are dependent upon, we end up having to add the changes to a lot of different areas of our application. In other words, we’re making our modules tightly coupled.When we use DI we are moving towards a more loosely coupled architecture where changing bits and pieces of a single modules affects the other areas of the application less. And, we can even swap them altogether, without other modules realizing.
