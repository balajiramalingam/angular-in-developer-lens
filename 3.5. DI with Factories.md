In the previous notes, we have seen, how to inject dependencies using custom injector and NgModule(). Now we are gonnaa see how to
inject dependencies which has parameters.

Imaging we have service named ```ParameterizedApiService``` for interacting with web services, which has one parameter called url. Provided value of url will be used by the ParameterizedApiService during webservice interaction, so in real application development, it will be help-ful for us to give different service
endpoints based on the environments ```dev/qa/stage```
```js
export class ParameterizedApiService {

  constructor(private url:string) { }

  get(): void {
   console.log(this.url);
  }

}

```
We can inject the above parametrized service in modules using factory,

Eg:
```js
providers: [
ParameterizedApiService,
{
provide: ParameterizedApiService,
useFactory: (): ParamService => new ParamService('https://dev.myservice.com/get')
}
]
```
## Factories with dependency

Even we can have factories with different dependency, it will be useful to inject different kind of dependency based on the environments.

Example 
In our application we have provided options to the users by login through "facebook" and "twiter".

if the user selected "facebook" then we have to check his login with FacebookApi or If its "twiter" then we have to validate against twitter
 
 in this case, we will inject dependencyCalled "AuthenticationService" service to our login component and "AuthenticationService" is going to be instance of either "FacebookApiService"/ "TwitterApiService".
 
 ```js   
 providers: [
 {
   provide: AuthenticationService,
   useFactory: (user) => {
      if (user.isPrefferredFacebook()) {
          return new FacebookApiService();
      }
      else{
          return new TwitterApiService();
      }
   },
   deps: [ User ]
}

```
## Injecting values
This is useful when we want to register a constant that can be redefined by another part of the application or even by environment (e.g. test or production).

```{ provide: 'API_URL', useValue: 'https://dev.myservice.com/get' }```
