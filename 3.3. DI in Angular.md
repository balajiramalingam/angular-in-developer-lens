# DI in Angular,
  Dependency injection was supported in Angular from the Angularjs1. Now we will see the implementation detail of Dependency injection system in Angular

Angular DI has the three parts -
```Providers```, ```Injector``` and ```Dependency```

* Dependencies will be registered with providers
* Modules to get the dependencies they will pass dependency tokens to the injector. Injector doesn't know how to the create them, so it will get the instructions from "Providers"  by passing the tokens. As dependencies are registered with providers during declaration, Providers knows how to create the them.
* After receiving the instruction, injector will create and serve the dependencies and also it will maintain a map bindings for dependencies. If the dependencies are requested again then injector will serve them from the map binding.

See the picture ```3.2.2. DI Working model.png``` for see the visual representation of the above.


Angular DI was well recieved by the web when it was introduced and it's one of the attracting feature of angular frame-work. But the DI system is not fulfilled all our requirements and it has following pit-falls

### Name collision: 
If we have a depedencey service named "LoginService", then we can't have one more dependency with same name. It has following issue.

Imagine our application depends on the two external modules "angular-local-storage" & "angular-cookies" to avail the browsers localStorage &  cookie storage, 

If both the modules has "StorageService".

"StorageService" of "angular-local-storage" has the setter/getter for storing the values in browser local storage memory.
"StorageService" of "angular-cookies" has the setter/getter for storing the values in browser cookie memory.

Now "StorageService" of both modules are collide with each other and at anytime only one will be avilable. We can't able to change the service name, as both are from extenal libraries.

Note:- In-real world, angular-local-storage/angular-cookies modules doesn't have service named "StorageService". For better understanding of the problem I have taken it.

Internal cache: Dependencies are created only once per application life cycle. Single instance of dependecy will be shared with the whole application , but in-times we may required to serve different instance of dependency to each module.

Tightly coulpled with framework: Dependency injection is really great feature. but we can't use it out-side the Angular, as everything in Angularjs bundled inside a single module. 

Eg:- Creating application in React with Angular Dependency module.

The above discussed issues were addressed in Angular2, we will see more on that in nect chapter.
